# The Kakebo Method: Mindful Saving

**Kakebo** (pronounced "kah-keh-boh") is more than just a budgeting tool; it's a philosophy. Originating in Japan in 1904, it was designed by Hani Motoko, Japan's first female journalist, to help busy women manage their household finances.

At its core, Kakebo is about **mindfulness**. It asks you to write down your income and expenses by hand (though our app helps you digitize this!), forcing you to confront your spending habits.

## The 4 Key Questions

Every Kakebo cycle revolves around four questions:

1. **How much money do you have available?**
2. **How much would you like to save?**
3. **How much are you spending?**
4. **How can you improve?**

## The 4 Categories

Expenses are divided into four "buckets":

*   **Survival (Needs):** Food, transport, medical, rent.
*   **Optional (Wants):** Dining out, shopping, drinks with friends.
*   **Culture:** Books, movies, museums, Spotify.
*   **Extra:** Unexpected expenses, gifts, repairs.

By categorizing your spending, you can easily identify where your money is going and where you can cut back without sacrificing your quality of life.

## Why Kakebo Works

In a digital world where money is invisible (credit cards, auto-payments), Kakebo makes your finances **tangible** again. It encourages you to pause and think before you buy.
